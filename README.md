# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
Welcome to our Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game!

## Overview 
This game is for anyone who is looking for a quick, easy and fun way to kill time, be it on the commute to work or wherever you have some time to kill. It is easy and intuitive for any user of any age, inspired by the hit series 'The Big Bang Theory'. For reference, lizard and spock is added to the common rock-paper-scissor game to reduce the chances of a 'draw'. 

## Features 
### Message Centre
This is where the feedback is given to the user on the outcome of each round, it tells the user if they have won, what they picked and what the computer picked

### Score Tracker
This feature keeps track of your score, tracking 'wins', 'losses' and 'draws'.

### Rules
This feature shows the game rules in a simple diagram to explain simply the logic behind the game.


## Tech Stack:
1. Balsamiq for wireframing
2. Github Projects for project management
3. HTML 5
4. CSS 3
5. Javascript
6. Miro
7. Bootstrap v4.6 (No longer using)

## Project Management
![Github Projects](/assets/images/RPSLS%20GithubProjects.png)

We created issues on Github for user stories and added the to Github Projects for the kanban board feature, so that we could have an overview of the project and delegate tasks in an agile way. 

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to play the game wherever I want so that I can have fun whenever 
* As a site user, I want to know what my score is so I can tell if I am winning
* As a user, I want to know the rules of the game so that I know how to win
* As a user, I want a personalised experience (extra feature in future iterations)

* As a site owner, I want users to have an enjoyable experience
* As a site owner, I want to monetize traffic by showing relevant ads to users (future)



## Testing

![Responsivity](/assets/images/amIresponsive.png)

Web app is fully responsive across all screen sizes. 

<img src="assets/images/Iphone-chrome.png" width="260" height="420">

<img src="assets/images/iphone-safari.png" width="260" height="420">

Web app was tested on iphone mobile device on 2 separate browsers, fully operational on both. One thing we realised is that the link styling on mobile devices is present in all the buttons which we would remove in future iterations so it is consistent with laptop browsers. 

![gamePlay](/assets/images/gameplay1.png)

All buttons are tested to see if fully functional at all times. We found that the score tracking presents some delays, it would initially pick up the score but then delay a turn, so each score update is a turn behind the actualy live gameplay. From our understanding, since the Javascript was not linear, functions were running ahead of clickEvents so while waiting for the clickEvent, the score function was getting held up and caused a backlog and hence a delay in the update.

![gameRules](/assets/images/gameRules.png)

We used pure HTML and CSS to create the modal since we removed Bootstrap, however after testing we realised that the gameRules button only works on the first click, that is because it takes us to the rules page which is a separate page (like what a Navbar does), it then hides display when closed so there is no way of opening it again without reloading the page. We could have made the play button go back to 'Home' if we realised this sooner. 

![resetGame](/assets/images/resetgame.png)

The reset button refreshes the whole page, and if you have opened the rules before, this will return the page with the rules already loaded up.



## Issues and solutions
Scores still buggy, would apporoach code in a more linear fashion next time. Throttling function has helped stop extra scores, but makes scores arrive late sometimes.
